# Spotify-Playlist-Analyzer
This project involves analyzing user-created playlists on Spotify to identify trends in music curation. You will use SQL to extract information about popular genres, the average duration of songs within playlists, and the top artists featured. The goal is to understand how users build their playlists and the factors that influence their choices.
